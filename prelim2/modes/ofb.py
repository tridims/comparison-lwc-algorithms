        Implementation of the Output Feedback mode of operation.

        This mode of operation divides the plaintext into segments of a fixed stream size, without requiring any padding,
            then the segments are encrypted sequentially, where each plaintext is XOR-ed with
                the most significant bits of encryption of a IV at the n-th stage. For the nth stage, the IV is
                    the encryption of the IV used in the previous stage.

        Since the IV is the data actually passed to the cipher, the plaintext may be divided into chunks much smaller
            than the block size, which avoids need of padding and allows operation as a stream cipher.

        Encryption:
            => C_i = P_i ^ MSB(E(IV_i, K), s), & IV_(i+1) = E(IV_i, K) where
                C_i = ciphertext block i,
                    P_i = plaintext block i
                        K = key used with the cipher
                            IV_1 = IV (Initialization Vector)
                                s = stream block size
                                    b = block size

        Decryption:
            => P_i = C_i ^ MSB(E(IV_i, K), s), as a result the decryption process
                also uses the encryption operation of the cipher.
